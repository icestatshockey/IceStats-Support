<section class="policy">
    <p>Thank you for using <strong>IceStats</strong>, an iOS application developed by Jacob Garcia ("we," "us," or "our"). IceStats is designed to help users track and manage hockey statistics locally on their devices. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your data remains secure and under your control.</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use IceStats. By using the app, you agree to the practices described in this policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the app.</p>

    <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
    <p>IceStats is a local, offline application that does <strong>not collect, transmit, or share any personal data</strong> with us or third parties. All data you enter is stored solely on your device using Apple's Core Data framework.</p>

    <p><strong>Types of Data Stored Locally:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User-Entered Data:</strong> This includes player information (e.g., names, jersey numbers, positions, teams, seasons) and hockey statistics (e.g., goals, assists, points, shots, faceoffs, goalie stats like saves, goals against, and time on ice).</li>
        <li><strong>No Automatic Collection:</strong> The app does not collect device identifiers, location data, IP addresses, or any other information automatically. There are no user accounts, analytics tracking, or integrations with external services.</li>
        <li><strong>No Sensitive Personal Data:</strong> We do not collect or process sensitive information such as health data, financial details, or biometric data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All data is input manually by you and remains on your device unless you choose to back it up via iCloud (managed by Apple) or export it yourself.</p>

    <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally, we do not access or use your information in any way. The app uses the data you provide solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Display and summarize hockey statistics within the app.</li>
        <li>Allow editing, deletion, and viewing of entries.</li>
        <li>Calculate derived stats (e.g., shooting percentage, faceoff percentage, goals-against average) based on your inputs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No data is used for advertising, marketing, or any other purpose beyond the app's core functionality.</p>

    <h3>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
    <p>We do <strong>not share, sell, rent, or disclose</strong> any of your data to third parties. IceStats does not connect to the internet or any external servers. Your data stays on your device.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Exceptions:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, such as in response to a court order or subpoena. However, since we do not collect or store data centrally, we have no data to provide in such cases.</li>
        <li><strong>App Transfers:</strong> If the app is acquired or merged with another entity, we will notify you of any changes to this policy before your data (if any were collected) is transferred.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Data Security</h3>
    <p>Your data is stored securely on your device using Apple's Core Data, which benefits from iOS security features like device encryption and app sandboxing. We recommend keeping your device updated and using strong passcodes or biometric authentication to protect your data.</p>
    <p>However, no system is completely secure. While we strive to protect your information through secure coding practices, we cannot guarantee absolute security against unauthorized access on your device.</p>

    <h3>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h3>
    <p>Your data is retained on your device for as long as you keep the app installed and do not delete it. You can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Delete individual entries (e.g., players, stats) directly in the app.</li>
        <li>Uninstall the app to remove all data (note: iCloud backups may retain data unless you delete them separately via your device settings).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not retain any copies of your data.</p>

    <h3>6. Children's Privacy</h3>
    <p>IceStats is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided data through the app, please contact us, and we will advise on how to delete it from the device.</p>

    <h3>7. International Users</h3>
    <p>IceStats is developed in the United States and is subject to U.S. laws. If you use the app from outside the U.S., you consent to the processing of your data (locally on your device) in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h3>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. Updates will be posted within the app or on our website (if applicable). Your continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h3>9. Contact Us</h3>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or the app's data practices, please contact us at:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:icestatshockey@gmail.com">icestatshockey@gmail.com</a></li>
        <li><strong>App Support:</strong> Via the App Store review process or direct feedback.</li>
    </ul>
