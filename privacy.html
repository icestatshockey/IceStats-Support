    <h1>IceStats Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date: January 16, 2026</strong></p>

    <p>Thank you for using <strong>IceStats</strong>, an iOS application developed by Jacob Garcia. IceStats is designed to help users track and manage hockey statistics locally on their devices. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your data remains secure and under your control. To improve app performance and measure usage, we now integrate with AppsFlyer (Zero Plan) for basic analytics and attribution, primarily focused on owned media activities.</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use IceStats. By using the app, you agree to the practices described in this policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the app.</p>

    <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>

    <p>IceStats primarily operates as a local application that stores user-entered data on your device using Apple's Core Data framework. However, to provide analytics features, we collect limited automatic data via the AppsFlyer SDK.</p>

    <p><strong>Types of Data Stored Locally:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User-Entered Data:</strong> This includes player information (e.g., names, jersey numbers, positions, teams, seasons) and hockey statistics (e.g., goals, assists, points, shots, faceoffs, goalie stats like saves, goals against, and time on ice).</li>
        <li><strong>No Sensitive Personal Data:</strong> We do not collect or process sensitive information such as health data, financial details, or biometric data.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All user-entered data is input manually by you and remains on your device unless you choose to back it up via iCloud (managed by Apple) or export it yourself.</p>

    <p><strong>Automatically Collected Data:</strong> Through the AppsFlyer SDK (Zero Plan), we collect the following for analytics and attribution purposes, in compliance with iOS privacy features like App Tracking Transparency (ATT) and SKAdNetwork (SKAN):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers (e.g., IDFV; IDFA only if you provide consent via the ATT prompt).</li>
        <li>IP address (which may be anonymized or hashed).</li>
        <li>App usage events (e.g., app installs, opens, and basic in-app actions, but limited to non-organic/owned media attribution in the Zero Plan).</li>
        <li>No location data, user accounts, or personally identifiable information is collected automatically unless tied to consented events.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For users who do not consent to tracking via ATT, data is handled in aggregated form via SKAN to preserve privacy.</p>

    <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>

    <p>User-entered data is used solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Display and summarize hockey statistics within the app.</li>
        <li>Allow editing, deletion, and viewing of entries.</li>
        <li>Calculate derived stats (e.g., shooting percentage, faceoff percentage, goals-against average) based on your inputs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Automatically collected data via AppsFlyer is used to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Measure app performance, such as install attribution from owned media.</li>
        <li>Provide basic analytics to improve the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>No data is used for advertising, marketing, or any other purpose beyond the app's core functionality and basic analytics.</p>

    <h3>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h3>

    <p>User-entered data is not shared, sold, rented, or disclosed to third parties. IceStats stores this data locally on your device.</p>

    <p><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> We share automatically collected data with AppsFlyer Inc. (a U.S.-based company) to provide analytics and attribution services under their Zero Plan. AppsFlyer processes this data as described in their <a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/legal/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>. We do not share data for paid advertising purposes.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Exceptions:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, such as in response to a court order or subpoena.</li>
        <li><strong>App Transfers:</strong> If the app is acquired or merged with another entity, we will notify you of any changes to this policy before your data is transferred.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Data Security</h3>

    <p>Your user-entered data is stored securely on your device using Apple's Core Data, which benefits from iOS security features like device encryption and app sandboxing. Automatically collected data is transmitted securely to AppsFlyer, who employs industry-standard security measures (e.g., encryption in transit and at rest). We recommend keeping your device updated and using strong passcodes or biometric authentication to protect your data.</p>

    <p>However, no system is completely secure. While we and AppsFlyer strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h3>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h3>

    <p>User-entered data is retained on your device for as long as you keep the app installed and do not delete it. You can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Delete individual entries (e.g., players, stats) directly in the app.</li>
        <li>Uninstall the app to remove all local data (note: iCloud backups may retain data unless you delete them separately via your device settings).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Automatically collected data is retained by AppsFlyer as needed for their services (typically up to 25 months for raw data). You can opt out of tracking via iOS settings or contact us for deletion requests, which we will forward to AppsFlyer.</p>

    <h3>6. Children's Privacy</h3>

    <p>IceStats is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided data through the app, please contact us, and we will advise on how to delete it from the device.</p>

    <h3>7. International Users</h3>

    <p>IceStats is developed in the United States and is subject to U.S. laws. If you use the app from outside the U.S., you consent to the processing of your data in accordance with this policy and applicable laws.</p>

    <h3>8. Your Privacy Rights</h3>

    <p>Depending on your location (e.g., California under CCPA), you may have rights to access, delete, or opt out of the sale/sharing of your personal information. To exercise these rights, contact us at the email below. We do not sell personal information.</p>

    <h3>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>

    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app or legal requirements. Updates will be posted within the app or on our website (if applicable). Your continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h3>10. Contact Us</h3>

    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or the app's data practices, please contact us at:</p>
